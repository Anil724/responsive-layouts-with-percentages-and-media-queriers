    <h1>SA is the toughest place to play cricket in the world.</h1>
    <p>
      Due to the climate, South African pitches are hard, fast at first, take
      spin later and they are mostly true even bounce for batting. But the heat
      can cause them to crack with time. English pitches take seam because they
      are grippy, Swing with moisture in the air and often don't totally dry
      out. So they are harder to bat on at the start of matches but stay more
      constant over 5 days of test cricket. Obviously, that is a generalisation
      and individual pitches have their own quirks.These pitches have no support
      whatsoever for the bowlers and batsmen love batting on them. These pitches
      are dark in color and have a solid feel about them. Every single bit of
      grass is rolled in, and all the moisture is taken away.Popularly known as
      the “Bullring” owing to its chaotic atmosphere from the stands, the New
      Wanderers Stadium in South Africa is one of the fastest cricket pitches in
      the world.Yes south africa is the toughest conditions for batting when
      compared to other SENA countries because south african ground having green
      top pitches which has lot of grass cover on it which assist seam bowling
      and swing as well.The Centurion pitch traditionally offers pace and
      bounce, favouring fast bowlers significantly. Spinners also benefit from
      the extra bounce to challenge batsmen. STAT ATTACK: 14 matches have been
      played at this venue and the teams batting second have won seven of
      those.In general, South African pitches are similar to Australian pitches,
      but with less bounce and more lateral movement. Fast bowlers who can hit
      the deck hard and create seam are most effective on these pitches.
      Spinners don't get much help and have to work hard.South Africa were
      surprised by the pace of the Newlands pitch on the first day of the New
      Year's Test but both stand-in captain Dean Elgar and batting consultant
      Ashwell Prince stopped short of out-and-out criticism of the surface. "It
      (The pitch) generally plays a little bit slower and as a batter you can
      adjust to that. This one just seemed to get quicker as the session went
      on," Elgar told Star Sports in his post-match interview. Prince, who spent
      the bulk of his career with Cape Town as his base, was more strident in
      his observations and claimed he had "never seen a Newlands pitch like this
      before," because in addition to the way the ball accelerated off the
      surface, there was also variable bounce and seam movement. "I've never
      seen the pitch that quick on day one," Prince said at the post-match press
      conference. "I don't think as batters you mind the pace in the wicket but
      then you need the bounce to be consistent. The bounce was a little bit
      inconsistent with some keeping low and some bouncing quite steeply.
      There's also the seam movement, which you don't mind on day one but if you
      have the seam movement with consistent bounce, then it's a different
      situation."
